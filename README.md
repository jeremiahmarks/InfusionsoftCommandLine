InfusionsoftCommandLine
=======================

Command line access to Infusionsoft implemented in Python


#Welcome

In order to get myself more aquainted with Infusionsoft [IS] and the API I have decided to write some simple command line
scripts to interact with it in Python.  These are those scripts.

#ToDo

* Save settings between sessions.
* Load all tags before loading contacts so that when displaying contacts tags will display as string, not Int
